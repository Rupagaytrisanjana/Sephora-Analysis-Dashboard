SEPHORA DATA ANALYSIS DASHBOARD!!!!! (MICROSOFT EXCEL)

I'm soooo into skincare and makeup products. SEPHORA is known for assisted self-service, we can literally grab whatever, you can try it on and choose what's the right fit. SEPHORA employs over 36,000 people, has more than 2,700 stores located over 35 countries these carries about 250 brands. SEPHORA is such a hot store for makeup brands to sell their products in it ends up having lot of leverage. So, coming to the project that I've done is a quite amount of SEPHORA's database. I solved some queries using EXCEL.


THE STEPS I FOLLOWED DURING THIS PROJECT ARE:

1.DATA COLLECTION AND CLEANING.

2.DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION.

3.DATA VISUALIZATION.

4.BUSINESS INSIGHTS.

5.DATA DRIVEN SOLUTIONS.

>STEP 1: The first thing I'd is "Data Cleaning" among the data fields. I removed some URL fields which are incomplete it's vast amount of data so deleting them is quite option for us. Replaced some data by using Find and Replace and added one column for ratings using nested if. if the ratings are 5 those are the best, if the ratings are 4.0 and 3.0 range those are good, if they are 2 or 1 it's avergae product. 

> STEP 2: "Data Preprocessing" is done by organizing the data numeric numbers highest to smallest or smallest to highest this enables me to solve some Top rated or Low priced products.

STEP 3: DATA ANALYSIS AND STORY TELLING:
>The first chat represents Top 10 Brands no of orders placed and the price of each. I created this chat using Column chart and line chart as secondary axis, turned out pretty good with pink.

>The second chart represents the online Rattings for different categories in Sephora's website. It is done by using Pivot tables and the sephora members can check and order the categories with high ratings.
>The 3rd chat is pie chart represents "Top Rated Brands" at Sephora.

>The fourth chart represents the best sunscreen as people these days in India re more into sunscreens so, thought it would be good one to choose. I solved it using "Pivot Table's and Pivot charts" I dragged category into row and Rating into value box, I've selected sunscreen category only.

>Hair care products are becoming more expensive these days and no. of products are getting manufactured by different brands. I've analyzed which haircare product is mostly used by people and the amount of it.

>Next chart represents "Are there any specific brands that consistently receive high ratings" again solved it using pivot table dragged brand into row box and ratings into value and selected standard deviation to know the spread.

>Finally, Dyson Air-wrap is the most expensive product at Sephora. Figured it out using filtering and sorting techniques. Sorted price category and we're good to go, choose the top most item that's your expensive product.
